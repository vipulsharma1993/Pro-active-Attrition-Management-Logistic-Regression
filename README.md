# Pro-active-Attrition-Management-Logistic-Regression
Business Case Overview: This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting customer churn at “ABC-VOICE,” a fictitious wireless telecom company, and use insights from the model to develop an incentive plan for enticing would-be churners to remain with ABC-VOICE.

Data for the case are available in csv format. The data are a scaled down version of the full database generously donated by an anonymous wireless telephone company. There are still 71,047 customers in the database, and 75 potential predictors. Trainees can use whatever method they wish to develop their predictive model. Logistic regression is perhaps the most obvious choice and is adequate for the task.

This case requires both statistical analysis and creativity/judgment. Steps :- Predicted customer churn from a telecom dataset with 71k records. -- Applied data cleaning, descriptive analysis, factor analysis, performance analysis of model done with KS Statistics, Gain & Lift chart. -- Accuracy was checked with the help of confusion matrix to determine precision. -- The key drivers were studied to find possible reasons of attrition & understand solution for retention. -- Model built in both SAS & R tools. -- Visualization & reporting done in Excel.
